 # Question 5
 
 Imagine you're trying to decide whether or not to go on a walk.
 
 You decide that you'll go on a walk if it's not raining **or** if it's more than 20C and sunny out.
 
 **First**, create a constant `isNiceWeather` that is equal to an expression that evaluates to a boolean indicating whether or not the weather is nice enough for you to go for a walk.
 
 **Second**, write an if statement that will print "I'm going for a walk!" if the weather is nice or "I'll stay inside today." if the weather is not suitable for a walk.
 
 - note: There are two situations here to consider.
    1. Going for a walk if it's not raining out.
    2. Going for a walk if it's more than 20C and sunny out.
 
    Make sure your code reports you going for a walk for both conditions!
 
    You'll need to adjust the value of the constants immedidately below to test your code thoroughly.
