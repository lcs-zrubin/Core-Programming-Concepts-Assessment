 # Question 6

 Write an `if-else if-else` statement that will print different statements based on what range `currentHeartRate` falls into.
 
 Below is a list of ranges and the associated statements
 
 - 100-120: "You are in the Very Light zone. Activity in this zone helps with recovery."
 - 121-140: "You are in the Light zone. Activity in this zone helps improve basice endurance and fat burning."
 - 141-160: "You are in the Moderate zone. Activity in this zone helps improve aerobic fitness."
 - 161-180: "You are in the Hard zone. Activity in this zone increases maximum performance capacity for shorter sessions."
 - 181-200: "You are in the Maximum zone. Activity in this zone helps fit athletes develop speed."
 
 If `currentHeartRate` is above the listed zones, print some kind of warning asking the user to slow down.
