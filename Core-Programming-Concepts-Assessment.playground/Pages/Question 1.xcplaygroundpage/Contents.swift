 # Question 1

 The code below translates a temperature measured in degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit.
 
 To complete this question:
 
 * where necessary, **change the constant names so they are more descriptive of what they keep track of**
 * revise all constant names to use the **camel case convention**
 
 Remember, when writing code in Swift, aim for **clarity**, not brevity.

import Foundation

// Revise code below to answer question 1
let tc : Double = 20
let tf = tc * 9 / 5 + 32
print("A temperature in degrees Celsius of \(tc) is equal to \(tf) in degrees Fahrenheit.")

 - callout(Shortcut): The **Edit All in Scope** menu command is useful when renaming variables – place your cursor within the variable name and then invoke the menu command.
